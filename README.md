# myAdvantageAssignment

This repository was created for the JAVA Engineer Academy admission assignment given by Advantage FSE, on January 2018.
It contains a function computing the largest possible number (combination wise) having as input random non negative integers.

**Description:**
Write a function accepting a list of non negative integers,
and returning their largest possible combined number
as a string. For example

*given [50, 2, 1, 9] it returns "95021" (9 + 50 + 2 + 1)
given [5, 50, 56] it returns "56550" (56 + 5 + 50)
given 420, 42, 423] it returns "42423420" (42 + 423 + 420)*

**main method contained in CombineLargestNumberLauncher.java file. Run  CombineLargestNumberLauncher.java to launch.**
**for ConcateTest.java to run, a JUnit library is needed. For the sake of the performed test, JUnit 5 was used.(Note: The aforemntionned examples were used as test cases in ConcateTest/java).**

**FYI: IDE used was Eclipse Oxygen.**
